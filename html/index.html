            <p>
                The world of coffee is at its best. Despite the fact that we still find a lot of bad coffee, the truth is
                that
                more and more coffee shops and people are beginning to discover the world of coffee. Within this sector we
                have
                to highlight specialty coffee or specialty coffee. In this post we are going to delve into this concept and
                everything it brings us.

            <h1>What is specialty coffee or "specialty coffee"?</h1>
            <p>
                The specialty coffee , special coffee or specialty coffee , is a type of coffee that is characterized by its
                artisan process. That is, from its collection, treatment, storage, roasting to its packaging and final
                consumption. This is the only way to get a quality or high-end coffee. Another way of defining specialty
                coffee in the broadest sense is coffee that has gone through all the processes from the tree to the cup in
                an artisanal way.
            </p>
            <p>
                This trend is gaining strength in Spain where consumers who consider themselves "coffee growers" are more
                aware of the flavor and aroma that this drink provides. A characteristic of this type of coffee is that it
                does not need sugar because it has no defects to hide. The taste of a good coffee is aromatic, sweet and
                smooth, unlike the industrial one that is usually bitter, hence the culture of adding sugar to coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect to highlight of specialty coffee is its origin . Like vegetables or fruits, coffee is a fruit
                that is harvested seasonally. In some regions it will be at one time of year and in others at another. For
                example, in spring the specialty coffee beans will come from countries like East Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya or
                Rwanda. This is the reason why we will not find specialty coffee in quantity in supermarkets. We are talking
                about a high quality product.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the role of barista is essential since it includes grinding the coffee. He not only knows
                what type of grinding is necessary for each variety of coffee, but he also knows the types of grinders and
                knows how to calibrate them. <br><br>

                In conclusion, we can affirm that specialty coffee is one that meets the following premises:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Be 100% Arabica variety</li>
                <li>Have a process from planting to the cup that is totally artisan</li>
                <li>The coffee beans must be harvested at their optimal point of maturity.</li>
                <li>Proceed from seasonal coffee beans</li>
                <li>Have a score of 80/100 points according to the international system for quality evaluation. This value
                    is given by a Q Grader or certified taster based on SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Con el paso de los años el mundo del café se ha ido profesionalizando, en gran parte, gracias a la
                Asociación de Cafés Especiales SCA (Specialty Coffee Association). Esta Institución ha conseguido con su
                gestión de eventos exclusivos para el mundo del café y sus certificados de catación integrar los grandes
                sectores industriales y cafeteros del mundo en esta cultura del café.

            <h1>What is the Specialty Coffee Association SCA?</h1>
            <p>
                The SCA is a non-profit association that represents thousands of coffee professionals, from producers to
                baristas from around the world. This organization emerged in 2017 after the merger of two other
                associations: the SCAE (Specialty Coffee Association of Europe) and the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association
                of America) . During the year they organize events such as international fairs to publicize specialty
                coffee. In the same way, they inform both producers and consumers about the quality of coffee, according to
                the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) in Latin America together with the
                Caribbean, the coffee-producing regions of greatest importance in the world as it is the one with the
                highest production.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the SCA is the only institutional organization that promotes education in the world of
                coffee with different modules that range from barista to taster, going through roaster, green coffee or
                brewing. The trainers teach courses all over the world and their training is internationally recognized.
                This is the only certification in the world of coffee recognized in more than 100 countries as the main
                source of knowledge and preparation of the greatest coffee professionals.

            <h1>What does the SCA promote?</h1>
            <p>
                The SCA promotes education in the world of coffee and the promotion of specialty coffee. Among its various
                educational programs are the Coffee Skills Program, the Coffee Sustainability Program, and the Coffee
                Technician Program, among others. From the SCA it is recommended to always start at the initiation level of
                any of its modules, although if the person has experience, they can do so at the intermediate level.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these training cycles, the coffee selection process and the fairs, the SCA tries to make the world
                aware of the importance of specialty coffee . We are talking about a market that is growing thanks to a
                public that increasingly appreciates the flavor of coffee and some producers who are willing to offer it at
                a good price. For this reason, its training programs are aimed at professionals in the sector such as
                baristas and coffee producers, as well as consumers.

            <h1>What makes a coffee with the Specialty Coffee Association seal different?</h1>
            <p>
                A coffee that has the SCA seal is a specialty coffee. Now we are going to summarize the aspects that
                determine the differences between commercial coffee and specialty coffee:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The harvesting process is carried out at its optimal point, that is, red cherries. This is important
                        not
                        only to get the true aroma of the coffee, since if the cherry is immature or overripe it tends to
                        generate a bitter taste. The collection is done by hand to separate those that are suitable from
                        those
                        that are not.</li>
                    <li>The cheeky. It is the moment in which the second quality control is applied. Even ripe red cherries
                        can
                        have blemishes so you have to look at them again to see those flaws that are not visible to the
                        naked
                        eye.</li>
                    <li>The roasted . The point of the coffee bean is measured until it reaches its final proof, serving it
                        in
                        the cup. Depending on the density, color and aroma, it will be known if it is a specialty coffee
                        suitable for consumption.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <a class="back" href="#firstContent">back to top</a><br><br>

            <h1>How can you get the SCA certificate?</h1>
            <p>
                When you want to determine the quality of coffee, a standardized protocol of the SCA is followed. In this
                process, coffee beans are analyzed to determine their defect and it is necessary to report their origin in
                order to have traceability of the process. During the tasting, carried out by a professional taster
                (Q-Grader), the following factors are determined:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>fragrance / scent</li>
                <li>Flavor</li>
                <li>aftertaste</li>
                <li>Acidity</li>
                <li>Balance</li>
                <li>Body</li>
                <li>sweetness</li>
                <li>taster score</li>
                <li>Uniformity</li>
                <li>clean cup</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the same way, to know the score, the following aspects are looked at:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>For category 1 , specialty coffee cannot have any defect.</li>
                <li>To achieve category 2, up to 5 defects are allowed: broken, immature, wrinkled, floating, parchment,
                    crushed, spongy, shelled, streaked, or shelled coffee beans.</li>
                <li>To obtain a sample of the coffee bean, about 350 grams must be provided.</li>
                <li>The light level on the table where the coffee beans are inspected for evaluation must be at least 4000
                    kelvin (K)/1200 Lux (lx)/120 foot candles (fc).</li>
                <li>The coffee beans must have a moisture content of less than 0.70aw.</li>
                <li>The variety must be 100% Arabica.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The score that to obtain the SCA certificate must be more than 80/100 according to its international quality
                evaluation system. This assessment is given by a Q Grader or certified taster. At Concafé we have specialty
                coffee from the Kfé brand from sustainable agriculture systems and with the SCA certificate.
